Research in the Jones lab examines the factors that influence animal foraging decisions including perception, learning, social learning, and memory. 
With a particular emphasis on the role of animal cognition in shaping ecological communities. 
Research is split between bumblebees in the lab at Bowdoin and with a range of pollinater taxa in the field on Kent Island.
