Hi All! This is the official GitHub page for the Patricia Jones lab at Bowdoin College. 

Research in the Jones lab examines the factors that influence animal foraging decisions including perception, learning, social learning, and memory. 
Specifically, our research focuses on the role of animal cognition in shaping ecological communities. 
Experimentation is split between populations of bumblebees in the lab at Bowdoin and populations of a range pollinators in the field on Kent Island.

For questions about our research, contact Patty Jones at pjones3@bowdoin.edu

For questions concerning the code posted here, contact Reed Warburton at rwarburt@bowdoin.edu
